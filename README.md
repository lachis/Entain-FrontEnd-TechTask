# Entain-FrontEnd-TechTask

First time using Vue, focused mostly on completing the challenge to demonstrate that even though I am unfamiliar with a techstack I can pick it up relatively quickly. I tried to use some of vue's framework apis (ref, watch etc) as they were the components of vue I felt were unique/different (compared to angular which I use regularly). Tried my best to focus on just the challenge of using those elements and completing the challenge. As a first pass, I tried to use those APIs as correctly as I could. Something else worth noting is that I opted to use Composition API over Options API not knowing what the standard for production apps is or what entain uses.

For this challenge, as I have already completed the golang backend I didnt want to spend too much time on beyond the actual challenge as such theres no focus on styling, unit tests or a breakdown of the NextToGo.vue component into smaller, dumb components.
